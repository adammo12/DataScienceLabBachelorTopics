## Topics for Bachelor Theses   

### Topic 1: Developing Interactive Website for Text Readability Assessment (Supervisor: Univ.-Prof. [Adam Jatowt](mailto: adam.jatowt@uibk.ac.at))

Readability measurement estimates how easy is to read a given text. Highly readable texts are accessible to users of varying educational background, reading skills or ones with limited knowledge of a given foreign language. Readability measures have been developed since some time ago taking into consideration the length of sentences, number of syllabes, grammatical and lexical complexity of text and so on. Recent measures use neural networks to determine readability scores of paragraphs or sentences. The objective of this topic is to develop an interactive tool which will take an input text either in the form of pdf, doc, txt or as pasted text and will return a range of readability measures and lexical complexity estimates for the text, as well as, will highlight the text portions that are difficult to read according to selected readability metric. The working languages should be German and English.

Prerequisites: basic knowledge of text processing

### Topic 2: Estimating Web Page Age (Supervisor: Univ.-Prof. [Adam Jatowt](mailto: adam.jatowt@uibk.ac.at))


### Topic 3: Designing Website for Image Age Estimation based on Age of Image Objects (Supervisor: Univ.-Prof. [Adam Jatowt](mailto: adam.jatowt@uibk.ac.at))


### Topic 4: Generating History-related Interactive Quizzes (Supervisor: Univ.-Prof. [Adam Jatowt](mailto: adam.jatowt@uibk.ac.at))

The objective of this topic is designing history-focused quiz generator for educational and entertaining objectives. Given a database of historical events in the form of short event descriptions, the task is to first generate a question for each event which is a valid and answerable question, using question generation tool based on transformers [link](https://github.com/patil-suraj/question_generation). Next, the system must generate a series of hints based on the actual answer to the created question and based on the received user answers. If user answers are incorrect the goal is to automatically provide hints which do not contain the ready answer but which help user come up with the answer. The hints should not too obvious but should lead the user to find the answer in small number of steps (few generated hints) by progressively revealing more data related to the answer. Hints will be generated using Wikipedia as knowledge base, as well as the original question, the correct answer and the sequence of user answers for previous hints.
