## Topics for Bachelor Theses   

### Topic 1: Developing Interactive Website for Text Readability Assessment (Supervisor: Univ.-Prof. [Adam Jatowt](mailto: adam.jatowt@uibk.ac.at))

Readability measurement estimates how easy is to read a given text. Highly readable texts are accessible to users of varying educational background, reading skills or ones with limited knowledge of a given foreign language. Readability measures have been developed since some time ago taking into consideration the length of sentences, number of syllabes, grammatical and lexical complexity of text and so on. Recent measures use neural networks to determine readability scores of paragraphs or sentences. The objective of this topic is to develop an interactive tool which will take an input text either in the form of pdf, doc, txt or as pasted text and will return a range of readability measures and lexical complexity estimates for the text, as well as, will highlight the text portions that are difficult to read according to selected readability metric. The working languages should be German and English.

Prerequisites: basic knowledge of text processing
