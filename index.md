## Topics for Bachelor Theses

### Topic 1: Developing Interactive Website for Readability Assessment (Supervisor: Univ.-Prof. [Adam Jatowt](mailto: adam.jatowt@uibk.ac.at))

Readability measurement estimates how easy is to read a given text. Highly readable texts are accessible to users of varying educational background, reading skills or ones with limited knowledge of foreign language. Readability measures have been developed since some time ago taking into consideration the length of sentences, numner of syllabes, grammatical and lexical complexity of text and so on.
