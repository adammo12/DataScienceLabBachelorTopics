## Topics for Bachelor Theses   

### Topic 1: Developing Interactive Website for Text Readability Assessment (Supervisor: Univ.-Prof. [Adam Jatowt](mailto:adam.jatowt@uibk.ac.at))

Readability measurement estimates how easy is to read a given text. Highly readable texts are accessible to users of varying educational background, reading skills or ones with limited knowledge of a given foreign language. Readability measures have been developed since some time ago taking into consideration the length of sentences, number of syllabes, grammatical and lexical complexity of text and so on. Recent measures use neural networks to determine readability scores of paragraphs or sentences. The objective of this topic is to develop an interactive tool which will take an input text either in the form of pdf, doc, txt or as pasted text content and will return a range of readability measures and lexical complexity estimates for the text, as well as, will highlight the text portions that are difficult to read according to a selected readability metric. This should enable end users get good overview of hpw difficult is the target text content from the perspective of several diverse metrics as well as understand which parts of the text may cause difficulties for readers. The working languages should be German or English, or both.

Prerequisites: good knowledge of text processing and machine learning techniques, as well as interactive web site design

### Topic 2: Developing Dataset and Designing Approach for Image Age Estimation based on Image Objects (Supervisor: Univ.-Prof. [Adam Jatowt](mailto:adam.jatowt@uibk.ac.at) in collaboration with [Antoine Doucet](https://pageperso.univ-lr.fr/antoine.doucet/) at Univ. of La Rochelle)

A significant number of old photographs including ones that are posted online do not contain the information of the date at which they were taken, or this information needs to be verified. Many of such pictures are either scanned analog photographs or photographs taken using a digital camera with incorrect settings. Automatically estimating the date of such pictures is useful for enhancing data quality and its consistency, improving information retrieval and for other related applications. The objective of this task is to propose an efficient approach for automatic estimation of the shooting dates of scanned born-analog photographs based on: (a) object detection and segmentation, (b) estimating age of detected objects and (c) ensembling date estimation for detected objects. The proposed method could borrow ideas from the initial work conducted in this direction [1]. The object segmentation approach that could be used is available [here](https://github.com/ArunMichaelDsouza/tensorflow-image-detection). The task assumes also generating a new dataset of segmented objects based on the existing [dataset](https://www.radar-service.eu/radar/en/dataset/tJzxrsYUkvPklBOw) which contains close to 1mln photographs taken over about 70 years of the 20th century.

Prerequisites: knowledge of image processing techniques, interest in history is a plus
