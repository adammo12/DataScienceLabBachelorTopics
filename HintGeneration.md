## Topics for Bachelor Theses   

### Automatically generating hints for Supporting question answering (Supervisor: Univ.-Prof. [Adam Jatowt](mailto:adam.jatowt@uibk.ac.at))

This topic assumes generating textual hints for users who want to answer a given question so that they can finally find the answer. If a user does not know an answer to a given question he or she will be offered a hint which is a short sentence or a word with information allowing the user find the answer. The hints are to be mined from Wikipedia content such that they are not too obvious but still allow users finding the correct answers.

More information can be found on the [Data Science's group page](https://ds-informatik.uibk.ac.at/).
